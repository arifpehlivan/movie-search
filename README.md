# movie-search

- I made api/clear(cache) 30 seconds after clicking the search button.
- I left the apikey part blank in .env.
- There was an error in the N/A part of the movie.Poster, I couldn't catch it. 
- I only worked for 2 days due to some of my work, I think I could have done better if I had more time. It was a simple and enjoyable project.
